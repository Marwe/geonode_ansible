# CSGIS GeoNode installation with Ansible
---
This Ansible playbook aims to install GeoNode by use of geonode-project to an Ubuntu Server. 
It tries to stay close to the installation instructions docs: http://docs.geonode.org/en/master/tutorials/install_and_admin/geonode_install/index.html
The tasks are currently quite low level using only one role. For a more versatile playbook visit: 
https://github.com/GeoNode/ansible-geonode

### Prerequisites
```
- Install Ansible https://www.ansible.com/
- Install Python on your target instance:  $ sudo apt install python-minimal
```

### File / Directory overview

- site.yml: the Top-Level playbook which includes plays from ./task and dictates the order.
- ./templates: J2 templates for Apache, Django, Geoserver, Tomcat. These are filled with vars from ./group_vars/all and copied by template module.
- ./assets: Has currently one file with GeoServer build information. Will be removed after geonode build server is introduced again.
- ./tasks: the different plays. Have a look at the GeoNode install docs. You will find similar separations
- ./handlers: service file for tasks

## Roadmap
- Tidy up, a lot of stuff can be done by use of ansible modules instead of `shell` or `command`
